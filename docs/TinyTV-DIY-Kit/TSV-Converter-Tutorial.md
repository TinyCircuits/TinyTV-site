.TSV (TinyScreen Video) is a file format used to play video on our TinyScreen products, including the TinyTV DIY Kit, our TinyScreen+, the Tiny Arcade, and Pocket Arcade. This page will cover how to use the Windows and MacOS program to convert any common video format to a .TSV file. It will also demonstrate how to play .TSV files on your TinyScreen+ with the <a href="https://tinycircuits.com/collections/memory/products/microsd-tinyshield" target="_blank" alt="micro SD TinyShield Product Page">**Micro SD TinyShield**</a>.

## Using the Program

Download either the MacOS or Windows version below:

### MacOS Download:

<center>***NOTE: The TSV Converter software is not compatible with MacOS Big Sur version 11.1. Big Sur versions 11.0.1 and 11.2, however, have been found to be compatible with the TSV Converter when tested.***</center>
<center>***
To find out what version of MacOS you are on, select the Apple icon on your home screen and select "About this Mac".
***</center>

If the download does not initiate when clicking the below link, right-click the link and select "Save link as..." and choose your desired location for the download.

<center><a href="https://files.tinycircuits.com/TSVConverterMacOS.zip" target="_blank" alt="Mac Apple OS TSV Converter Zip Download" >**Download MacOS TSV Converter**</a></center>

The Mac operating system has some extra security measures, so to open the MacOS TSV Converter, you might need to select "Open When Done" or "Keep" to force it to complete the download:

Navigate to where the program has downloaded in Finder, double click the zip file to unzip it, then right click to **_Open_** the file.

<center><img src="https://github.com/TinyCircuits/Wiki-Tutorials-Supporting-Files/raw/master/Utilities/TSVConverter-Tutorial/images/TSVConverter-Tutorial-Image-03.jpg" /></center>

By selecting **_Open_**, the app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can with any registered app.

Once the TSV Converter has successfully downloaded, you should be able to open it:

You are now ready to select some video files to convert!

Click "Open File". This will open your file explorer and allow you to select a video file. The video will load into the TSVConverter application. From here you can press "Convert File"

That's it! The .tsv file should appear in the same folder as your selected file, you can navigate there by clicking "Open Folder". If you want to edit the output of your movie, you can select your output's aspect ratio, and then convert the video again for a different ratio.

The last step is moving your .tsv files onto your SD Card. Once you plug the SD Card into your computer, your SD Card will appear as a clickable icon on your Mac Desktop. Double click on this SD Card icon to open its contents. Click and drag any .tsv file you want on your TV into this SD Card folder. Once you are done adding .tsv videos, safely eject the SD Card by right-clicking on the SD Card icon and selecting "_Eject "[SD Card Name]"_".

Remove the SD Card from your computer and plug it into the bottom of the TinyTV to watch your converted videos!
