The TinyTV Converter App is used to convert and scale videos for TinyCircuits TinyTV devices. Our TinyTVs are small and require specific video formats, so you will need to convert all videos you want on your TinyTV using the App from this tutorial. 

_Note: If you are looking to convert videos to load onto the <a href="https://tinycircuits.com/products/tinytv-diy-kit" target="_blank" alt="TinyTV Kit product page">**TinyTV DIY Kit**</a> (shipped before Summer 2023) please refer to the <a href="../TinyTV-DIY-Kit/TSV-Converter-Tutorial/" target="_blank" alt="TinyCircuits TSV Converter tutorial">**TSV Converter**</a> application tutorial._

    **Mac (M1 and M2) Accessory Approval**

    The silicon processors available in MacOS devices starting in November 2020 have an additional USB device security protocol that you must accept when connecting your TinyTV in order to place converted videos into the TinyTV's memory. When plugging in a USB device, you may see this pop-up window:

<br>

    - Copy and paste or drag converted _.avi_ files to the external drive. Wait for the copy to complete, it may take a few moments

## Troubleshooting

- **"I'm getting an error on my Mac device about allowing the accessory to connect?"** - Please review the <a href="#installation" alt="">**installation steps**</a> for MacOS to remedy the error.
- If the TinyTV 2 or TinyTV Mini USB device does not appear on your computer - your USB-C cable may not have the necessary data connections required for transferring data. Try using other USB-C cables.
- If you cannot see the resulting converted video, refresh your file explorer in the directory you saved the file. _Try pressing the convert button again if the video is not present._
- Do not use the same title for converted videos repeatedly in the same file location. The file will not be overwritten correctly and only the first video with the title will be saved. Change the title each time you press the convert button to avoid errors or losing video data.
