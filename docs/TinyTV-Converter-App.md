The TinyTV Converter App is used to convert and scale videos for TinyCircuits TinyTV devices. Our TinyTVs are small and require specific video formats, so you will need to convert all videos you want on your TinyTV using the App from this tutorial. 

_Note: If you are looking to convert videos to load onto the <a href="https://tinycircuits.com/products/tinytv-diy-kit" target="_blank" alt="TinyTV Kit product page">**TinyTV DIY Kit**</a> (shipped before Summer 2023) please refer to the <a href="../TinyTV-DIY-Kit/TSV-Converter-Tutorial/" target="_blank" alt="TinyCircuits TSV Converter tutorial">**TSV Converter**</a> application tutorial._

## Upload Converted Videos

- **Connect**
    - For TinyTV 2 and Mini users plug the TV using a USB-C cable, after a few seconds an external storage drive will appear on your computer.<br>_Note: For TinyTV DIY Kit users, remove the SD card from your TV and insert it into your computer or card reader_
<br>
- **Copy**
    - Copy and paste or drag converted _.avi_ files to the external drive. Wait for the copy to complete, it may take a few moments
<br>
- **Eject**
    - Once you're done copying files, be sure to right-click the external drive and click **eject**

## Troubleshooting

- If the TinyTV 2 or TinyTV Mini USB device does not appear on your computer - your USB-C cable may not have the necessary data connections required for transferring data. Try using other USB-C cables.
- If you cannot see the resulting converted video, refresh your file explorer in the directory you saved the file. _Try pressing the convert button again if the video is not present._
