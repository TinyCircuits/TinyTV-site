### Mac (M1 and M2) Accessory Approval

The silicon processors available in MacOS devices starting in November 2020 have an additional USB device security protocol that you must accept when connecting your TinyTV in order to place converted videos into the TinyTV's memory. When plugging in a USB device, you may see this pop-up window:

<center><img width="40%" height="40%" src="../images/Mac-USB-Accessory.png"/></center>
<center>_Screen capture of the 'Open' option highlighted_</center>


Please review <a href="https://support.apple.com/lt-lt/guide/mac-help/mchlf779ae93/mac" target="_blank" alt="">**Mac's publication on allowing accessories to connect to Mac**</a> to learn how to approve USB device accessories.

## Open the Application

Once you have downloaded the correct application version for your system, you can start converting videos!

<center><img width="60%" height="60%" src="../images/Converter-dark-opening-button.JPG" /></center>
<center>_Note: The application is available in light and dark mode and will be set automatically based on your system settings. Shown here is the dark mode version of the app._</center>

Press the button to select a video you wish to convert.

Once you have selected the video file you want to convert to put on the TV, the app will open to the main screen. On the left side of the app, the video you selected is playable and viewable - note that this feature is not available for all video types or video ratios, you will need your video to have an .MP4 extension to be compatible with the TinyTV application. If you have a video in a different format, you can use video editing software to export it as an .MP4, or you can use a free in-browser tool like <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/video-converter" alt="Cloud Convert browser tool for converting video types">**CloudConvert**</a>. Once you have an .MP4, you should be able to select it from the app!

## TV Model

Select the TinyTV Model compatible with your hardware. Please note that the video output for each TV is not cross-compatible, so it is important to select the correct TV Model at this stage.

---

## Crop

To customize the appearance of your video, you can select any of the 3 crop options: Contain, Cover, or Fill. The selected crop option will change the appearance of the video player to depict the resulting video format.

<center><img width="50%" height="50%" src="../images/Crop-settings.jpg" /></center>
<center>_Contain, Cover, Fill_</center>

Keep in mind, the crop settings are applied based on the TV Model. For example, the crop setting *Fill (Stretch)* on the TinyTV Mini that has a 1:1 video ratio with 64x64 pixels will not display as stretched due to the size and video ratio limitations. To see how the input video will appear with the different crop settings, we recommend converting your video with the different crop settings so that you can see how they are affected. 

*Note: The preview of the crop settings in the application window will give you an idea of how the different settings effect the resulting video, but the preview is an estimate rather than a guaranteed visual.*

## Output Name

Choose a short and meaningful title for your TinyTV video. Note that special characters and titles longer than 50 characters are not compatible with the TV firmware. Remove any special characters in the title before placing the video on your TinyTV by sticking to a-z letters and 0-9 numbers.

---

## Put Converted Videos on Your TinyTV or TinyTV SD Card

Press the convert button once all of the above selections and title look good. A save dialog window will direct you to save your file.

**DIY TinyTV Kit 96x64**:

- Place converted videos on the USB Drive of the SD Card you have plugged into your computer. Eject the USB drive before removing it from your computer to avoid file corruption.

**TinyTV 2 and TinyTV Mini**:

-  These TinyTVs have a USB Mode that will make your TinyTV appear on your computer just like an external drive, either in your Folder Explorer (Windows) or on your desktop/Finder Application (Mac). You can select the TinyTV device directory when converting videos to save the videos directly to your TinyTV's storage. To enter USB Mode:

    - <ins>Current TinyTV Software</ins>: turn your TV on and connect it to your computer with a USB-C cable, after a few seconds the directory of the TinyTV should appear.
    - <ins>Do you have a TinyTV with different software?</ins> - <a href="https://tinytv.us/Update/" target="_blank" alt="TinyTV firmware updated tool">**Update Software Here**</a>

You can plug the TV into your computer and you can save your converted videos directly to the USB Drive directory that will appear when the TinyTV is connected to your computer with a USB-C cable while powered on. 

_Note: Your TinyTV USB drive may show up as "Untitled"_

Don't forget to eject your TinyTV USB drive once you are done adding videos!

<center><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://github.com/TinyCircuits/Wiki-Tutorials-Supporting-Files/raw/master/Utilities/TinyTV-App/Mac-eject-USB.jpg" /></center>
<center>_To eject the TinyTV USB drive on MacOS, right click or double press to view the options menu and select the "Eject" option_</center>

---

## Charging TinyTV's

You can use a USB power cable to connect your TinyTV to your computer or another power source. A yellow charging LED will turn on when your TinyTV is charging. The yellow LED will turn off when your TinyTV is fully charged.

## Troubleshooting

- **"I'm getting an error on my Mac device about allowing the accessory to connect?"** - Please review the <a href="#mac-m1-and-m2-accessory-approval" alt="">**M1 and M2 Mac-users section**</a> to remedy the error.
- **"My app appears frozen while I am converting a video"** - Don't worry, this is completely normal. Your video is being converted by the TinyTV app and while it may look like the app is frozen, it's just working hard!
- If the TinyTV 2 or TinyTV Mini USB device does not appear on your computer - your USB-C cable may not have the necessary data connections required for transferring data. Try using other USB-C cables.
- If you cannot see the resulting converted video, refresh your file explorer in the directory you saved the file. _Try pressing the convert button again if the video is not present._
- Do not use the same title for converted videos repeatedly in the same file location. The file will not be overwritten correctly and only the first video with the title will be saved. Change the title each time you press the convert button to avoid errors or losing video data.
