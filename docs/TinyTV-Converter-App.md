On the left side of the app, the video you selected is playable and viewable - note that this feature is not available for all video types or video ratios. For best compatibility, use .mp4 type videos.

## TV Option

Select the TinyTV Model compatible with your hardware. Please note that the video output for each TV is not cross-compatible, so it is important to select the correct TV Model at this stage.

## Output Name

Choose a short and meaningful title for your TinyTV video. Note that special characters and titles longer than 50 characters are not compatible with the TV firmware. Remove any special characters in the title before placing the video on your TinyTV by sticking to a-b letters and 0-9 numbers.

## Put Converted Videos on Your TinyTV or TinyTV SD Card

Press the convert button once all of the above selections and title look good. A save dialog window will direct you to save your file.

DIY TinyTV Kit 96x64:

- Place converted videos on the USB Drive of the SD Card you have plugged into your computer. Eject the USB drive before removing it from your computer to avoid file corruption.

TinyTV 2 and TinyTV Mini:

- You can plug the TV into your computer and you can save your converted videos directly to the USB Drive directory that will appear when the TinyTV is connected in **USB mode** and powered on.
- How to enter **USB mode**:

      - TinyTV 2: Plug the TinyTV 2 into your computer. Turn off the TinyTV with the top power button while holding the button in for 5 seconds. After 5 seconds, release the button and then press it once. You should see a message on the screen stating the TinyTV is in "USB Mode". The USB drive will appear in your file explorer (Windows), or as a drive on your home screen (Mac):

Don't forget to eject your TinyTV USB drive once you are done adding videos!

## Charging TinyTV's

You can use a USB power cable to connect your TinyTV to your computer or another power source. A yellow charging LED will turn on when your TinyTV is charging. The yellow LED will turn off when your TinyTV is fully charged.

## Troubleshooting:

- **"My app appears frozen while I am converting a video"** - Don't worry, this is completely normal. Your video is being converted by the TinyTV app and while it may look like the app is frozen, it's just working hard!
- If the TinyTV 2 or TinyTV Mini USB device does not appear on your computer - your USB-C cable may not have the necessary data connections required for transferring data. Try using other USB-C cables.
- If you cannot see the resulting converted video, refresh your file explorer in the directory you saved the file. _Try pressing the convert button again if the video is not present._
- Do not use the same title for converted videos repeatedly in the same file location. The file will not be overwritten correctly and only the first video with the title will be saved. Change the title each time you press the convert button to avoid errors or losing video data.
