## Assembly

<center><img src="https://github.com/TinyCircuits/TinyCircuits-TinyTV-ASK4002/raw/master/images/TinyTV-Tutorial-Image-02.png" alt="TinyTV 3D printed pieces" /></center>

Starting with your 3D printed TV housing, gently break out the extra 3D printed pieces from inside of the cabinet. These will be used shortly. 

<center><img src="https://github.com/TinyCircuits/TinyCircuits-TinyTV-ASK4002/raw/master/images/TinyTV-Tutorial-Image-03.png" alt="TinyScreen+ with battery plugged in" /></center>

Next, remove the screen protector from the TinyScreen+. Plug the battery into the back of the TinyScreen+ board and the speaker into the MicroSD/ Audio TinyShield where it is labeled Speaker.

**CAUTION: the next steps require delicacy, be gentle with the TinyScreen+ as the side switch can break off.**

Locate the 3D printed switch piece that we broke out of the TV housing previously. Insert into the slot. The ON/OFF switch on the TinyScreen+ will rest inside of this switch.

**Next, Gently push the TinyScreen+ into place making sure that the switch on the TinyScreen+ is in alignment with the 3D printed switch. Make sure not to pinch the Battery wires.**

Then snap the MicroSD/Audio board + speaker into place making sure again not to pinch the speaker wires.

Take the additional pieces we broke out earlier and slid them into the slots located on either side of the inside of the TV. These will help hold the components into place.

Then stack your battery into place and remove the adhesive backing off of the speaker. Stick the speaker to the inside of the back of the TV pressing firmly. *Note: Making a firm seal with the speaker adhesive to the inside of the TinyTV enclosure panel ensures the maximum output of sound from the speaker - you can test the strength of the seal by playing videos on the TV and adding pressure to the speaker*

Up next pop the back of the TV into place, it is easiest to place the top in first and then the bottom should push into place.

Insert your Preloaded MicroSD, we recommend using a pair of tweezers to secure it into place.

The <a href="https://tinycircuits.com/collections/components/products/tiny-remote" target="_blank" alt="Tiny Remote Product Page">**Tiny Remote**</a>  will work best when directed toward the top of the TinyTV where the receiver is, and will work about 12-18in. away from the unit - making it perfect for a desk accessory!

To customize your viewing experience, you can use the <a height="50%" width="50%" href="../TinyTV-Tutorial/"  alt="Change Settings and IR remote values tutorial">**Settings Menu Tutorial**</a> to turn off the TinyTV program for the Tiny Video Player program.
