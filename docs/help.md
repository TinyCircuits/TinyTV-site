# TinyTV Help & FAQ Page


## Charging TinyTV's

You can use a USB power cable to connect your TinyTV to your computer or another power source. A orange charging LED will turn on when your TinyTV is charging. The orange LED will turn off when your TinyTV is fully charged.


## Can I expand the storage?

All TinyTVs come with an 8GB micro SD Card pre-loaded with some demo videos. The micro SD Card is removable only with the TinyTV DIY Kit using tweezers and the cutout slot on the bottom of the TV case. The TinyTV 2 and TinyTV Mini sets have the micro SD Card built in without ready-access - ***While it's theoretically possible to disassemble these models and put in a larger SD Card, we don't recommend or support this since it could damage the electronics without proper caution or equipment.***

A playback error will occur when a video file cannot be loaded, or if playback cannot continue for the given file. Check your storage on your TinyTV and make sure the videos have been converted with the correct TinyTV Model, and that all the files have been converted using the TinyTV Converter Application. The TinyTV video formats are custom to the hardware, so you will need to use our free converter.

## "No Card" or "Storage card not detected"

The SD Card in the hardware is not detectable - this error occurs when no SD Card is inserted, or if the SD Card is loose on the contacts. Try re-inserting the SD Card if possible.

A few things can trigger a storage malfunction error. This error occurs when the SD Card is detected, but the filesystem is damaged or unrecognizable. This can also happen if your file names include unexpected, or special, characters - if you see this error, try changing the names of your files on the SD Card.
