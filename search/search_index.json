Yashusi Enari, a TinyCircuits customer in Tokyo, Japan, discovered the TinyScreen+ and began creating his own tiny miniatures with these tiny screens. One of these projects was a retro miniature 3D printed television set, which he called the MAME-TV (Mame translates to \"Bean\" in English): Yashusi Enari's MAME-TV Project The project impressed his friends and gained enough popularity that Yashusi decided to start making more custom-painted TVs to sell to other miniature enthusiasts at events like Maker Faire Tokyo. He created a company named Panda Precision to do this, and started to collaborate with us at TinyCircuits to improve the kit. He continued to 3D print and hand build all of the MAME-TVs in his Tokyo apartment, and it became increasingly popular where he had difficulty keeping up with demand. Sadly, Yashusi was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2018 and began undergoing intensive treatment, which made it difficult to continue with his project that he was so passionate about. In early 2019, a tumor was found in his brain, and he asked us to continue this project on his behalf. We then worked together on an improved version of the MAME-TV, which could scale up and be made available to more people - this work lead to the TinyTV DIY Kit. Our friend Yashusi Enari passed away on May 1st, 2019. We miss him, and dedicate this project to his memory. The MAME-TV project still lives on through Yashusi's friend Guru Hoshi in Japan, who continues making these amazing custom MAME-TVs . h4 { opacity: 0; } What is the TinyTV? Launched in late 2019, the TinyTV DIY Kit allowed people to create their own TinyTV, load their own videos, and paint the TV to look however they wanted. Built upon the TinyCircuits TinyDuino family, this kit has been extremely popular and well-received. While the kit aspect of this is fun for a lot of people, we did hear from others who would prefer it already assembled, and easier to load their own videos on. So we began working on the next generation TinyTV platform including the TinyTV 2 and TinyTV Mini. Check out this video displaying the differences in the TinyTV screens using prototype versions of the TinyTV 2 and TinyTV Mini: Check out this comparison chart for a more in-depth look at the differences in tech specs: About Us We are TinyCircuits , and we specialize in making small electronics for makers and hobbyists.

If you bought the Tiny Video Player Kit, this program comes pre-installed so that you can get started watching, or converting and uploading videos. There are a few different settings options for how you can play and watch videos (as of April 2020). If you bought the Tiny Video Player Kit and you are looking for the resource that teaches you how to add your own videos to the Tiny Video Player, you can skip directly to the TSV Converter Tutorial Materials Hardware: Micro USB Cable Tiny Video Player Kit or Individual Components: TinyScreen+ Processor Board - Runs the program, has a SAMD 32-bit processor, OLED screen, USB and power circuitry. Micro SD / Audio TinyShield - Designed specifically for use with the TinyScreen+, this TinyShield has the micro SD card adapter, audio driver and IR receiver (which can receive TV remote control signals). 290 mAh Rechargeable Lithium Polymer Battery - Used to power your video player, and is recharged when the USB is plugged into the TinyScreen+ board. 16x9 Speaker - for audio playback on videos 8GB Micro SD card and Adapter - preloaded with sample videos. Extras: Some videos! Fun Fact: The micro SD card that comes with the kit is 8 GB, which may seem small, but most movies are around 1-2GB each. HD movies tend to be closer to 5GB, but that is still an impressive amount of memory in such a tiny package. Step 1: Assembly (Hardware) There is no soldering or complicated configurations to worry about, you simply have to plug connectors into the right places to assemble this project. Starting with the SD and Audio TinyShield, plug in the SD card and the speaker to the slots on the TinyShield. Plug the battery into the 2 pin connector on the TinyScreen+. *Be careful! The TinyScreen+ and the SD and Audio TinyShield both have a tan 2 pin connector. Make sure the battery is plugged into the TinyScreen+, and the speaker is plugged into the SD and Audio TinyShield. * Then attach the TinyScreen+ to the SD and Audio TinyShield via the tan 32-pin connectors. The complete setup of the Tiny Video Player Turn the switch on the TinyScreen+ to ON. Step 2: Software (Setup) If you have not already, download the Arduino IDE. This is the platform, or application we will use to upload a program to the TinyScreen+ so that it will work as a Tiny Video Player. To setup the Arduino IDE to program the TinyScreen+, open up the Arduino IDE after downloading. You need to make these selections under the Tools tab: Tools -> Board -> \"TinyScreen+\" Tools -> Port -> \"COM##(TinyScreen+)\" Programmer -> \"Arduino as ISP\" Tools selections If you have any issues finding the correct port, you can unplug the microUSB cable and plug it back in while noting which COM## disappears and reappears during this process. Step 3: The Code! At this point, you have everything set up to upload the program to your TinyScreen+. Download the following zip file of the Tiny Video Player program and open it in the Arduino IDE: Tiny Video Player Arduino Program After the program is uploaded, the Tiny Video Player program will begin playing all the files on the SD Card that have the .tsv extension in order. The Tiny Video Player program has the following functionality programmed for the TinyScreen+ buttons: If you want to add some new videos or movies to your SD Card, you can move on to the TSV Converter Tutorial that shows you exactly how to do that using the TSV (TinyScreen Video) Converter. To sum up using the TSV Converter, you simply need to download either the MacOS or Windows app, open it and then upload the files you want to convert to the .tsv format.

Your TinyScreen+ should begin playing the videos stored on your micro SD card in the order you added them. If you have any issues finding the correct port, you can unplug the microUSB cable and plug it back in while noting which COM## disappears and reappears during this process. How it works After the program is uploaded, the TinyTV will begin playing the first video listed on the SD Card with a .tsv extension. Each video on the SD Card will show up as a \"channel\" that you can scroll through with the channel buttons on the remote. The videos all begin playing as soon as the TinyTV is turned on to mimic a real TV. When left on a channel, the video on that \"channel\" will repeat. Use the Tiny Remote to control your TinyTV from a distance (the remote works best about 12-18in. away from an IR Receiver. Works best with the TinyTV when pointed toward the top - where the receiver is) , or use the following diagram of button functions right on the TinyTV enclosure: To customize your viewing experience, you can use the Settings Menu Tutorial to turn off the TinyTV program for the Tiny Video Player program.

Different Sized Screens Can I use a different sized screen with the TinyTV hardware? Other screens that may be bigger, smaller or have different resolutions are unfortunately not be compatible with the TinyTV hardware. Screens vary greatly between different sizes and resolutions with their hardware pins. The supporting TinyTV hardware is custom to the 0.96\" screen in the kit. We hope to offer TV's and video players with different sized screens in the future, but those screens will also require supporting hardware customized to their pins and size. Different Power Source How can I wire a different power source to continuously power the TinyTV? There are a few different options to answer this question depending on the constraints of you or your project's needs - read through all the options in this forum post . Additionally, if you plan on permanently installing the TV in a diorama, miniature or otherwise, it may help to change the settings of the TV beforehand to auto-play and loop videos loaded on the SD Card when powered, check out the Settings Menu tutorial to learn more. Electronics Inside TV Can I buy just the electronics inside the TV? Yes! You can buy just the electronics inside the TinyTV by purchasing the Tiny Video Player Kit . This kit does not include the Tiny Remote . 3D Cases I want to create my own TV case - what resources do you have available? There is a hardware diagram in the photo reel of the Tiny Video Player Kit that displays the measurements of the assembled hardware that goes inside the TinyTV enclosure (including the TinyScreen+, MicroSD & Audio TinyShield, battery, and speaker). The STL files of the TinyTV enclosure are available from the TinyTV product page under DOWNLOADS . Additionally, there is a hardware diagram of the TV enclosure at the end of the TinyTV product page photo reel. The TV enclosures we distribute are printed using SLS Nylon with a raw finish by the 3D printing service JawsTec . We use professional grade printers due to the small size and level of detail put into the TinyTV enclosure, so please keep this in mind while using different 3D printers. No Display My screen is not working, how can I check if it has been damaged? If no display is showing, it's possible that the screen could have been damaged during shipment or assembly. Or that the converted videos are somehow corrupted or have no visual from the original video. To check that the screen is working - try putting the TinyScreen+ board into bootloader mode. When correctly done, the TV will display \"TinyScreen+ Bootloader Mode\" on the screen. To put the hardware in bootloader mode, turn off the TV device (switch should be down), and then hold in the top-left button closest to the micro USB port while turning the unit back on. The most important part is keeping the button held in. Make sure the battery is charged and try this a few times to see if you can get anything to appear on the screen. Bootloader mode Charging How do I charge the TinyTV? To charge the TV you will need a Micro USB B cable . Once you have the cable, you just need to plug it into the TV and a power source. You will know it is charging by the amber/yellow LED that turns on. The LED will turn off once it's fully charged. Autoplay & Loop Videos Is there a way to \"loop\" or \"auto-play\" the videos when the TV is turned on? Can I change the remote codes to use a different remote? Yes! These features are easily edited by using the Settings Menu . Painting Tips What is the best paint to use when painting the TinyTV enclosure? We covered a few different options, including using Sharpies, in our Painting and Customization tutorial . Check it out! SD Card I turn the TV on and get the message \"Card not found!\" Make sure the SD Card is fully inserted. Then double-check that the SD & Audio TinyShield is fully joined to the TinyScreen+ board inside the TV - It may help to take the SD & Audio TinyShield completely out of the TV enclosure to try and reseat it. My new SD Card is not working with the TV. Try reformatting the SD Card to FAT32 using an SD Card Formatting Utility . Make sure any important files on the SD Card are moved before starting this process - all files will be deleted during formatting. Remote The remote is not working. The remote works best when pointing it directly at the top of the TinyTV enclosure, as this is where the receiver is within the TV. The remote will work around 12-16 inches away from the TV - this can change depending on the thickness of the TV enclosure and the amount of paint layered on the TV. Make sure the battery is fully seated in the battery holder. You can check that the remote is working by pressing one of the six white buttons while looking at the bottom of the remote. A red LED on the bottom of the board will flicker when a button is pressed. You can test that the IR Receiver inside the TV is working by using any other IR Remote with the IR settings menu on the TinyTV (to get to the settings menu, turn the TV off with the power switch and while holding the top right TV button, turn the TV back on). Check out the full settings tutorial for more information. TV Buttons The buttons are not working when I press them on the TV case If there is an issue with the buttons, it could be the way the hardware is seated in the case. We would recommend removing the hardware from the case gently, then try the buttons while the hardware is outside of the case to see if that works. Volume How can I make the TV louder? You should be able to get around 2-5x the sound by pressing and installing the speaker more firmly. To do this, take off the white sticker and adhere the speaker firmly against a flat surface (like on the inside of the TV's back panel). It may help to have the TinyTV on with a video playing and testing the audio while pressing on the speaker. The volume on the TV is limited by the volume of the video that is converted using the TSV Converter . Make sure that you are converting videos with louder volume, or consider editing the volume on a video with a utility like Photoshop or Affinity. Videos Not Playing Why are some of my videos are not playing on the TinyTV? If the title of the video is too long, the videos will not display. Try keeping the titles of the videos shorter than 50 characters. \"For example - this sentence is 50 characters long!\" It's not common, but it is possible that the .mp4 video or .tsv converted video file is corrupted. Please make sure the video is playable on your computer before converting it, and then be sure to safely eject the SD Card from your computer to avoid any file corruption issues. The title includes characters/symbols outside of A-Z, 0-9 that are making the video unreadable by the program. The TV program cannot process accented or non-english letters. The source files could be protected by a DRM (digital rights management). Make sure you are converting videos that you have the rights to alter and convert. Some Channels are Empty or Glitching All of the videos I added are working, but there are some channels I switch to that are empty or glitch, what's going on? There could be invisible files that your computer put on your SD Card! MacOS is most known for loading invisible files into any folder or location on your computer to organize files and upkeep some different OS functions.
